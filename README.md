# PowerShell | IP port scanner

Powerful asynchronus IP port scanner for PowerShell.

## Description

This powerful asynchronus IP port scanner allows you to scan every port range you want (500 to 2600 would work). Only TCP ports are scanned.

The result will contain the port number, protocol, service name, description and the status.

To reach the best possible performance, this script uses a [RunspacePool](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/system.management.automation.runspaces.runspacepool(v=vs.85).aspx). As you can see in the following screenshot, the individual tasks are distributed across all cpu cores:
